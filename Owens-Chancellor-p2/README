## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, 
We have added color to the program 
and plan to do the menu next.
The scroll function while simple,
is causng the most trouble. 
Also KEY_RESIZE should get us through resizing the window.

lab07: we have split up to multiple thing faster but will converge tonight.
I have implemented a menu using ncurses and found out how to close the program with esape
I am still having trouble understanding how the program closes 
without pressing esape.
